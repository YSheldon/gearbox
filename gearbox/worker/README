To test out this the worker framework

1) start gearmand:

gearmand -v -v -v -q libsqlite3 --libsqlite3-db=/tmp/gearman.db

2) start worker:

sudo ./test

(the log output will go to /var/gearbox/all.log)

3) run client/job

gearman -f hello "{'name': 'coryb'}"

That should return "Hello coryb";

You can run it in the background with the -b option.  No
output will be printed, but you can see the result in the log.
